# WebDev-WebAppCA
A project assigned in Web Development II in my first year of college. The task was to build a web application using the Python web framework Flask. This app also had to include a database.

Welcome to my continuous assessment project. It is based on a car dealership website where you can investigate various vehicles and choose one that's right for you.

The following are some key features of this app that I believe are particularly worth taking a look at:  
  ⚪ A filter form on the home page to narrow down a search for a specific vehicle, including a sort by field  
  ⚪ A recently viewed tab which sits at the side of the homepage's screen. It updates every time you visit a new vehicle's details page. This feature does not require a user to be logged in.  
  ⚪ A watchlist which displays the added vehicles' details in a compact form.  
  ⚪ An account page which enables a user to change their name, username, or password.  
  ⚪ An administration page, allowing admin users to view all orders placed, remove users, and suggest new entries into the database.

I have implemented an admin login which requires a user to enter an admin code on registration.
